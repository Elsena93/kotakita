						<div class="col-md-6">
							<p>We believe that citizens should be at the heart of the decision-making process that determines the environment and the quality of living of the urban centers they reside in. They are entitled to governance that is inclusive, transparent and socially just.</p>
							<p>We are a non-profit organization based in the Indonesian city of Solo with expertise in urban planning and citizen participation in the design and development of cities. We provide education, facilitate citizen participation and collective action, and work with governments to build bridges between officials and their constituencies.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<p>In our experience carrying out projects in 12 rapidly urbanizing Indonesian cities, we have found that when citizens and stakeholders understand urban issues and work together, services improve, poverty is reduced and inequality narrows, as poor communities become empowered to make a living.</p>
							<p>The bulk of our work has been in Indonesia, but we have taken our knowledge and experience to other fast urbanizing countries in the region, where participatory governance is on the agenda and is gaining momentum.</p>

										<p>John leads the foundation, he helps come up with ideas, conducts research and analysis, as well as connects with government, community, civil society partners and donors. John has served as a technical advisor on urban programs and research initiatives to UN-HABITAT Indonesia, Mercy Corps Indonesia, and the Asia Foundation; he has worked in Angola, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and Timor Leste on urban development, governance and planning issues. He has Masters degree in Urban Planning from Harvard University.</p>
